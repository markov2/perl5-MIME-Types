# MIME::Types

  * My extended documentation: <http://perl.overmeer.net/CPAN/>
  * Development via GitHub: <https://github.com/markov2/perl5-MIME-Types>
  * Download from CPAN: <ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MARKOV/>
  * Indexed from CPAN: <https://metacpan.org/release/MIME-Types>

## Development &rarr; Release

Important to know, is that I use an extension on POD to write the manuals.
The "raw" unprocessed version is visible on GitHub.  It will run without
problems, but does not contain manual-pages.

Releases to CPAN are different: "raw" documentation gets removed from
the code and translated into real POD and clean HTML.  This reformatting
is implemented with the OODoc distribution (A name I chose before OpenOffice
existed, sorry for the confusion)

Clone from github for the "raw" version.  For instance, when you want
to contribute a new feature.

On github, you can find the processed version for each release.  But the
better source is CPAN; to get it installed simply run:

```sh
   cpan -i MIME::Types
```

## Contributing

When you want to contribute to this module, you do not need to provide
a perfect patch... actually: it is nearly impossible to create a patch
which I will merge without modification.  Usually, I need to adapt the
style of code and documentation to my own strict rules.

When you submit an extension, please contribute a set with

1. code

2. code documentation

3. regression tests in t/
